The fact that amanda's model and my model produce approximately the same results shows that the population posteriors are behaving simularly. 
The problem is then likely with either the parameter estimation or the mmms code. Likley the former. Further investigations will continue. 

I've tested changing the Jacobian of the PE and that seems to have no effect. 

Next steps, I will try to pull the samples again from a different folder (Reed's paper folder) and apply alt-hdf2csv conversion to that instead.
