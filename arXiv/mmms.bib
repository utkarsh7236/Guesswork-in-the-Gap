  abstract = {We report on gravitational wave discoveries from compact binary coalescences detected by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo in the first half of the third observing run (O3a) between 1 April 2019 15:00 UTC and 1 October 2019 15:00. By imposing a false-alarm-rate threshold of two per year in each of the four search pipelines that constitute our search, we present 39 candidate gravitational wave events. At this threshold, we expect a contamination fraction of less than 10\%. Of these, 26 candidate events were reported previously in near real-time through GCN Notices and Circulars; 13 are reported here for the first time. The catalog contains events whose sources are black hole binary mergers up to a redshift of \textasciitilde 0.8, as well as events whose components could not be unambiguously identified as black holes or neutron stars. For the latter group, we are unable to determine the nature based on estimates of the component masses and spins from gravitational wave data alone. The range of candidate events which are unambiguously identified as binary black holes (both objects \$\textbackslash geq 3\textasciitilde M\_\textbackslash odot\$) is increased compared to GWTC-1, with total masses from \$\textbackslash sim 14\textasciitilde M\_\textbackslash odot\$ for GW190924\_021846 to \$\textbackslash sim 150\textasciitilde M\_\textbackslash odot\$ for GW190521. For the first time, this catalog includes binary systems with significantly asymmetric mass ratios, which had not been observed in data taken before April 2019. We also find that 11 of the 39 events detected since April 2019 have positive effective inspiral spins under our default prior (at 90\% credibility), while none exhibit negative effective inspiral spin. Given the increased sensitivity of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, the detection of 39 candidate events in \textasciitilde 26 weeks of data (\textasciitilde 1.5 per week) is consistent with GWTC-1.},

  abstract = {Properties of dense nucleon matter and the structure of neutron stars are studied using variational chain summation methods and the new Argonne {$v$}18 two-nucleon interaction, which provides an excellent fit to all of the nucleon-nucleon scattering data in the Nijmegen database. The neutron star gravitational mass limit obtained with this interaction is 1.67{$M\odot$}. Boost corrections to the two-nucleon interaction, which give the leading relativistic effect of order ({$v$}/{$c$})2, as well as three-nucleon interactions, are also included in the nuclear Hamiltonian. Their successive addition increases the mass limit to 1.80 and 2.20 {$M\odot$}. Hamiltonians including a three-nucleon interaction predict a transition in neutron star matter to a phase with neutral pion condensation at a baryon number density of {$\sim$}0.2 fm-3. Neutron stars predicted by these Hamiltonians have a layer with a thickness on the order of tens of meters, over which the density changes rapidly from that of the normal to the condensed phase. The material in this thin layer is a mixture of the two phases. We also investigate the possibility of dense nucleon matter having an admixture of quark matter, described using the bag model equation of state. Neutron stars of 1.4{$M\odot$} do not appear to have quark matter admixtures in their cores. However, the heaviest stars are predicted to have cores consisting of a quark and nucleon matter mixture. These admixtures reduce the maximum mass of neutron stars from 2.20 to 2.02 (1.91) {$M\odot$} for bag constant {$B$} =200 (122) M⁢e⁢V/f⁡m3. Stars with pure quark matter in their cores are found to be unstable. We also consider the possibility that matter is maximally incompressible above an assumed density, and show that realistic models of nuclear forces limit the maximum mass of neutron stars to be below 2.5{$M\odot$}. The effects of the phase transitions on the composition of neutron star matter and its adiabatic index {$\Gamma$} are discussed.},

In this article, we describe the KAGRA data management system, i.e., recording of data, transfer from the KAGRA experiment site to computing resources, as well as data distribution to tier sites, including international sites in Taiwan and Korea. The amount of KAGRA data exceeded 1.0 PiB and increased by about 1.5~TB per day during operation in 2020. Our system has succeeded in data management, and has achieved performance that can withstand observations after 2023, that is, a transfer rate of 20 MB s-1 or more and file storage of sufficient capacity for petabyte class. We also discuss the sharing of data between the global gravitational-wave detector network with other experiments, namely LIGO and Virgo. The latency, which consists of calculation of calibrated strain data and transfer time within the global network, is very important from the view of multi-messenger astronomy using gravitational waves. Real-time calbrated data delivered from the KAGRA detector site and other detectors to our computing system arrive with about 4--15 seconds of latency. These latencies are sufficiently short compared to the time taken for gravitational wave event search computations. We also established a high-latency exchange of offline calibrated data that was aggregated with a better accuracy compared with real-time data.},

  abstract = {The theory governing the strong nuclear force---quantum chromodynamics---predicts that at sufficiently high energy densities, hadronic nuclear matter undergoes a deconfinement transition to a new phase of quarks and gluons1. Although this has been observed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions2,3, it is currently an open question whether quark matter exists inside neutron stars4. By combining astrophysical observations and theoretical ab initio calculations in a model-independent way, we find that the inferred properties of matter in the cores of neutron stars with mass corresponding to 1.4 solar masses (M{$\odot$}) are compatible with nuclear model calculations. However, the matter in the interior of maximally massive stable neutron stars exhibits characteristics of the deconfined phase, which we interpret as evidence for the presence of quark-matter cores. For the heaviest reliably observed neutron stars5,6 with mass M\,{$\approx$}\,2M{$\odot$}, the presence of quark matter is found to be linked to the behaviour of the speed of sound cs in strongly interacting matter. If the conformal bound \$\$\textbraceleft c\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash rm\textbraceleft s\textbraceright\textbraceright\textasciicircum\textbraceleft 2\textbraceright\textbackslash le 1/3\$\$(ref. 7) is not strongly violated, massive neutron stars are predicted to have sizable quark-matter cores. This finding has important implications for the phenomenology of neutron stars and affects the dynamics of neutron star mergers with at least one sufficiently massive participant.},

This Galactic X-ray binary consists of a compact object, wind-fed by a Wolf-Rayet (WR) type companion. Based on a comprehensive analysis of observational data, it was recently argued that Cyg X-3 harbors a 2-4.5 Msun BH and a 7.5-14.2 Msun WR companion. We find that the fate of such a binary leads to the prompt ({$<$}1 Myr) formation of a close BH-BH system for the high end of the allowed WR mass (M\_WR{$>$}13 Msun). For the low- to mid-mass range of the WR star (M\_WR=7-10 Msun) Cyg X-3 is most likely (probability 70\%) disrupted when WR ends up as a supernova. However, with smaller probability, it may form a wide (15\%) or a close (15\%) BH-NS system. The advanced LIGO/VIRGO detection rate for mergers of BH-BH systems from the Cyg X-3 formation channel is 10 per year, while it drops down to 0.1 per year for BH-NS systems. If Cyg X-3 in fact hosts a low mass BH and massive WR star, it lends additional support for the existence of BH-BH/BH-NS systems.},

  abstract = {A number of recent works have highlighted that it is possible to express the properties of general-relativistic stellar equilibrium configurations in terms of functions that do not depend on the specific equation of state employed to describe matter at nuclear densities. These functions are normally referred to as "universal relations" and have been found to apply, within limits, both to static or stationary isolated stars, as well as to fully dynamical and merging binary systems. Further extending the idea that universal relations can be valid also away from stability, we show that a universal relation is exhibited also by equilibrium solutions that are not stable. In particular, the mass of rotating configurations on the turning-point line shows a universal behaviour when expressed in terms of the normalised Keplerian angular momentum. In turn, this allows us to compute the maximum mass allowed by uniform rotation, M\_\textbraceleft max\textbraceright, simply in terms of the maximum mass of the nonrotating configuration, M\_\textbraceleft TOV\textbraceright, finding that M\_\textbraceleft max\textbraceright{} \textasciitilde{} (1.203 +- 0.022) M\_\textbraceleft TOV\textbraceright{} for all the equations of state we have considered. We further show that a universal relation can be found between the dimensionless moment of inertia and the stellar compactness. Although this relation is not surprising as it involves two quantities that have been shown to exhibit universal behaviour with other stellar properties, our parameterisation represents a refinement over a similar relation by Lattimer and Schutz (2005), where a different normalisation was used, and could provide an accurate tool to constrain the equation of state of nuclear matter when measurements of the moment of inertia become available.},

  abstract = {The continued operation of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors is enabling the first detailed measurements of the mass, spin, and redshift distributions of the merging binary black hole population. Our present knowledge of these distributions, however, is based largely on strongly parametric models. Such models typically assume the distributions of binary parameters to be superpositions of ``building block'' features like power laws, peaks, dips, and breaks. Although this approach has yielded great progress in the initial characterization of the compact binary population, the strong assumptions entailed often leave it unclear which physical conclusions are driven by observation and which by the specific choice of model. In this paper, we instead model the merger rate of binary black holes as an unknown autoregressive process over the space of binary parameters, allowing us to measure the distributions of binary black hole masses, redshifts, component spins, and effective spins with near-complete agnosticism. We find the primary mass spectrum of binary black holes to be doubly peaked, with a fairly flat continuum that steepens at high masses. We identify signs of unexpected structure in the redshift distribution of binary black holes: a uniform-in-comoving volume merger rate at low redshift followed by an increase in the merger rate beyond redshift {$z$} {$\approx$}0.5. Finally, we find that the distribution of black hole spin magnitudes is unimodal and concentrated at small but nonzero values, and that spin orientations span a wide range of spin-orbit misalignment angles but are also moderately unlikely to be truly isotropic.},

  abstract = {Detection of black holes (BHs) with detached luminous companions (LCs) can be instrumental in connecting the BH properties with their progenitors since the latter can be inferred from the observable properties of the LC. Past studies showed the promise of Gaia astrometry in detecting BH--LC binaries. We build on these studies by (1) initializing the zero-age binary properties based on realistic, metallicity-dependent star formation history in the Milky Way (MW); (2) evolving these binaries to current epoch to generate realistic MW populations of BH--LC binaries; (3) distributing these binaries in the MW, preserving the complex age--metallicity-Galactic position correlations; (4) accounting for extinction and reddening using three-dimensional dust maps; and (5) examining the extended Gaia mission's ability to resolve BH--LC binaries. We restrict ourselves to detached BH--LC binaries with orbital period P orb {$\leq$} 10 yr such that Gaia can observe at least one full orbit. We find that (1) the extended Gaia mission can astrometrically resolve {$\sim$}30--300 detached BH--LC binaries depending on our assumptions of supernova physics and astrometric detection threshold; (2) Gaia's astrometry alone can indicate BH candidates for {$\sim$}10--100 BH--LC binaries by constraining the dark primary mass {$\geq$}3 M {$\odot$}; and (3) distributions of observables, including orbital periods, eccentricities, and component masses, are sensitive to the adopted binary evolution model and hence can directly inform binary evolution models. Finally, we comment on the potential to further characterize these BH binaries through radial velocity measurements and observation of X-ray counterparts.},

  abstract = {The Advanced LIGO gravitational wave detectors are second generation instruments designed and built for the two LIGO observatories in Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA. The two instruments are identical in design, and are specialized versions of a Michelson interferometer with 4 km long arms. As in initial LIGO, Fabry-Perot cavities are used in the arms to increase the interaction time with a gravitational wave, and power recycling is used to increase the effective laser power. Signal recycling has been added in Advanced LIGO to improve the frequency response. In the most sensitive frequency region around 100 Hz, the design strain sensitivity is a factor of 10 better than initial LIGO. In addition, the low frequency end of the sensitivity band is moved from 40 Hz down to 10 Hz. All interferometer components have been replaced with improved technologies to achieve this sensitivity gain. Much better seismic isolation and test mass suspensions are responsible for the gains at lower frequencies. Higher laser power, larger test masses and improved mirror coatings lead to the improved sensitivity at mid- and high- frequencies. Data collecting runs with these new instruments are planned to begin in mid-2015.},

The signal, GW170817, was detected with a combined signal-to-noise ratio of 32.4 and a false-alarm-rate estimate of less than one per \$8.0\textbackslash times10\textasciicircum 4\$ years. We infer the component masses of the binary to be between 0.86 and 2.26 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$, in agreement with masses of known neutron stars. Restricting the component spins to the range inferred in binary neutron stars, we find the component masses to be in the range 1.17 to 1.60 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$, with the total mass of the system \$2.74\textasciicircum\textbraceleft +0.04\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft -0.01\textbraceright\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$.

The association with the gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A, detected by Fermi-GBM 1.7 s after the coalescence, corroborates the hypothesis of a neutron star merger and provides the first direct evidence of a link between these mergers and short gamma-ray bursts. Subsequent identification of transient counterparts across the electromagnetic spectrum in the same location further supports the interpretation of this event as a neutron star merger. This unprecedented joint gravitational and electromagnetic observation provides insight into astrophysics, dense matter, gravitation and cosmology.},

The 90\% credible intervals for the component masses range from 1.12 to 2.52 \$M\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash odot\textbraceright\$ (1.45 to 1.88 \$M\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash odot\textbraceright\$ if we restrict the dimensionless component spin magnitudes to be smaller than 0.05).

There are 35 compact binary coalescence candidates identified by at least one of our search algorithms with a probability of astrophysical origin \$p\_\textbackslash mathrm\textbraceleft astro\textbraceright{} {$>$} 0.5\$. Of these, 18 were previously reported as low-latency public alerts, and 17 are reported here for the first time. Based upon estimates for the component masses, our O3b candidates with \$p\_\textbackslash mathrm\textbraceleft astro\textbraceright{} {$>$} 0.5\$ are consistent with gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes or neutron star-black hole binaries, and we identify none from binary neutron stars. However, from the gravitational-wave data alone, we are not able to measure matter effects that distinguish whether the binary components are neutron stars or black holes. The range of inferred component masses is similar to that found with previous catalogs, but the O3b candidates include the first confident observations of neutron star-black hole binaries. Including the 35 candidates from O3b in addition to those from GWTC-2.1, GWTC-3 contains 90 candidates found by our analysis with \$p\_\textbackslash mathrm\textbraceleft astro\textbraceright{} {$>$} 0.5\$ across the first three observing runs. These observations of compact binary coalescences present an unprecedented view of the properties of black holes and neutron stars.},

  abstract = {We report the observation of gravitational waves from two compact binary coalescences in LIGO's and Virgo's third observing run with properties consistent with neutron star-black hole (NSBH) binaries. The two events are named GW200105\_162426 and GW200115\_042309, abbreviated as GW200105 and GW200115; the first was observed by LIGO Livingston and Virgo, and the second by all three LIGO-Virgo detectors. The source of GW200105 has component masses \$8.9\textasciicircum\textbraceleft +1.2\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft -1.5\textbraceright\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$ and \$1.9\textasciicircum\textbraceleft +0.3\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft -0.2\textbraceright\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$, whereas the source of GW200115 has component masses \$5.7\textasciicircum\textbraceleft +1.8\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft -2.1\textbraceright\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$ and \$1.5\textasciicircum\textbraceleft +0.7\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft -0.3\textbraceright\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$ (all measurements quoted at the 90\% credible level). The probability that the secondary's mass is below the maximal mass of a neutron star is 89\%-96\% and 87\%-98\%, respectively, for GW200105 and GW200115, with the ranges arising from different astrophysical assumptions. The source luminosity distances are \$280\textasciicircum\textbraceleft +110\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft -110\textbraceright\$ Mpc and \$300\textasciicircum\textbraceleft +150\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft -100\textbraceright\$ Mpc, respectively. The magnitude of the primary spin of GW200105 is less than 0.23 at the 90\% credible level, and its orientation is unconstrained. For GW200115, the primary spin has a negative spin projection onto the orbital angular momentum at 88\% probability. We are unable to constrain spin or tidal deformation of the secondary component for either event.

  abstract = {We present results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the CMB. These data are consistent with the six-parameter inflationary LCDM cosmology. From the Planck temperature and lensing data, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0= (67.8 +/- 0.9) km/s/Mpc, a matter density parameter Omega\_m = 0.308 +/- 0.012 and a scalar spectral index with n\_s = 0.968 +/- 0.006. (We quote 68\% errors on measured parameters and 95\% limits on other parameters.) Combined with Planck temperature and lensing data, Planck LFI polarization measurements lead to a reionization optical depth of tau = 0.066 +/- 0.016. Combining Planck with other astrophysical data we find N\_ eff = 3.15 +/- 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and the sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {$<$} 0.23 eV. Spatial curvature is found to be \textbar Omega\_K\textbar{} {$<$} 0.005. For LCDM we find a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r {$<$}0.11 consistent with the B-mode constraints from an analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP data leads to a tighter constraint of r {$<$} 0.09. We find no evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects. The equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 +/- 0.045. Standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the Planck LCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We investigate annihilating dark matter and deviations from standard recombination, finding no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base LCDM are in agreement with BAO data and with the JLA SNe sample. However the amplitude of the fluctuations is found to be higher than inferred from rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. Apart from these tensions, the base LCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

  abstract = {Neutron stars are composed of the densest form of matter known to exist in our universe, and thus provide a unique laboratory for exploring the properties of cold matter at super-nuclear density. Measurements of the masses or radii of these objects can strongly constrain the neutron-star matter equation of state, and consequently the interior composition of neutron stars. Neutron stars that are visible as millisecond radio pulsars are especially useful in this respect, as timing observations of the radio pulses provide an extremely precise probe of both the pulsar's motion and the surrounding space-time metric. In particular, for a pulsar in a binary system, detection of the general relativistic Shapiro delay allows us to infer the masses of both the neutron star and its binary companion to high precision. Here we present radio timing observations of the binary millisecond pulsar PSR J1614-2230, which show a strong Shapiro delay signature. The implied pulsar mass of 1.97 +/- 0.04 M\_sun is by far the highest yet measured with such certainty, and effectively rules out the presence of hyperons, bosons, or free quarks at densities comparable to the nuclear saturation density.},

  abstract = {We introduce the first complete non-parametric model for the astrophysical distribution of the binary black hole (BBH) population. Constructed from basis splines, we use these models to conduct the most comprehensive data-driven investigation of the BBH population to date, simultaneously fitting non-parametric models for the BBH mass ratio, spin magnitude and misalignment, and redshift distributions. With GWTC-3, we report the same features previously recovered with similarly flexible models of the mass distribution, most notably the peaks in merger rates at primary masses of \$\textbraceleft\textbackslash sim\textbraceright 10\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$ and \$\textbraceleft\textbackslash sim\textbraceright 35\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$. Our model reports a suppressed merger rate at low primary masses and a mass ratio distribution consistent with a power law. We infer a distribution for primary spin misalignments that peaks away from alignment, supporting conclusions of recent work. We find broad agreement with the previous inferences of the spin magnitude distribution: the majority of BBH spins are small (\$a{$<$}0.5\$), the distribution peaks at \$a\textbackslash sim0.2\$, and there is mild support for a non-spinning subpopulation, which may be resolved with larger catalogs. With a modulated power law describing the BBH merger rate's evolution in redshift, we see hints of the rate evolution either flattening or decreasing at \$z\textbackslash sim0.2-0.5\$, but the full distribution remains entirely consistent with a monotonically increasing power law.

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Hierarchical Bayesian inference can simultaneously account for both measurement uncertainty and selection effects within astronomical catalogs. In particular, the imposed hierarchy encodes beliefs about the interdependence of the physical processes that generate the observed data. We show that several proposed approximations within the literature actually correspond to inferences that are incompatible with any physical detection process. This generically leads to biases and is associated with the assumption that detectability is independent of the observed data given the true source parameters. We show several examples of how this error can affect astrophysical inferences based on catalogs of coalescing binaries observed through gravitational waves, including misestimating the redshift evolution of the merger rate as well as incorrectly inferring that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity when it is not. In general, one cannot directly fit for the “detected distribution” and “divide out” the selection effects in post-processing. Similarly, when comparing theoretical predictions to observations, it is better to simulate detected data (including both measurement noise and selection effects) rather than comparing estimates of the detected distributions of event parameters (which include only selection effects). While the biases introduced by model misspecification from incorrect assumptions may be smaller than statistical uncertainty for moderate catalog sizes (O(100) events), they will nevertheless pose a significant barrier to precision measurements of astrophysical populations.}

Nonetheless, the systems' component masses will generally be constrained precisely. Constructing an explicit mixture model for the total rate density of merging compact objects, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian analysis to classify gravitational-wave sources according to the posterior odds that their component masses are drawn from different subpopulations. Accounting for current uncertainty in the maximum neutron star mass and adopting a power-law mass distribution with or without a mass gap and either random or mass-ratio-dependent pairing, we examine two recent events from the LIGO--Virgo Collaboration's third observing run, GW190425 and GW190814. For population models with no overlap between the neutron star and black hole mass distributions, we typically find that there is a chance, depending on the exact population model, that GW190425 was a binary neutron star merger rather than a neutron-star--black-hole merger. On the other hand, we find that there is a chance that GW190814 involved a slowly spinning neutron star, regardless of our assumed population model.}

Furthermore, we find weak evidence that GW170817 involved at least one NS based on gravitational-wave data alone (\$B\textasciicircum\textbraceleft NS\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft BBH\textbraceright = 3.3 \textbackslash pm 1.4\$), consistent with the observation of electromagnetic counterparts. We also investigate GW170817's implications for the maximum spin frequency of millisecond pulsars, and find that the fastest known pulsar is spinning at more than 50\% of its breakup frequency at 90\% confidence. We additionally find modest evidence in favor of quark matter within NSs, and GW170817 favors the presence of at least one disconnected hybrid star branch in the mass--radius relation over a single stable branch by a factor of 2. Assuming there are multiple stable branches, we find a suggestive posterior preference for a sharp softening around nuclear density followed by stiffening around twice nuclear density, consistent with a strong first-order phase transition. While the statistical evidence in favor of new physics within NS cores remains tenuous with GW170817 alone, these tantalizing hints reemphasize the promise of gravitational waves for constraining the supranuclear EOS.},

  abstract = {Astrophysical observations of neutron stars probe the structure of dense nuclear matter and have the potential to reveal phase transitions at high densities. Most recent analyses are based on parametrized models of the equation of state with a finite number of parameters and occasionally include extra parameters intended to capture phase transition phenomenology. However, such models restrict the types of behavior allowed and may not match the true equation of state. We introduce a complementary approach that extracts phase transitions directly from the equation of state without relying on, and thus being restricted by, an underlying parametrization. We then constrain the presence of phase transitions in neutron stars with astrophysical data. Current pulsar mass, tidal deformability, and mass-radius measurements disfavor only the strongest of possible phase transitions (latent energy per particle \$\textbackslash gtrsim 100\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\textbraceleft MeV\textbraceright\$). Weaker phase transitions are consistent with observations. We further investigate the prospects for measuring phase transitions with future gravitational-wave observations and find that catalogs of \textbackslash result\textbraceleft\$O(100)\$\textbraceright{} events will (at best) yield Bayes factors of \$\textbackslash sim 10:1\$ in favor of phase transitions even when the true equation of state contains very strong phase transitions. Our results reinforce the idea that neutron star observations will primarily constrain trends in macroscopic properties rather than detailed microscopic behavior. Fine-tuned equation of state models will likely remain unconstrained in the near future.},

We analyze all gravitational wave detections by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA made through the end of the first half of the third observing run, and find clear evidence for two different populations of compact objects based solely on gravitational wave data. We confidently (99.3\%) find a steepening relative to a single power law describing neutron stars and low-mass black holes below \$2.4\textasciicircum\textbraceleft +0.5\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft -0.5\textbraceright\textbackslash text\textbraceleft{} M\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash odot\textbraceright\$, which is consistent with many predictions for the maximum neutron star mass.

We analyze GW190814 self-consistently in the context of the full population of compact binaries, finding support for its secondary to be either a neutron star or a lower mass gap object, consistent with previous claims. Our models are the first to accommodate this event, which is an outlier with respect to the binary black hole population. We find that GW200105 and GW200115 probe the edges of, and may have components within, the lower mass gap.

Abbott et al., ApJ Lett., 896, L44 (2020)]? This is the central question animating this letter. Covariant density functional theory provides a unique framework to investigate both the properties of finite nuclei and neutron stars, while enforcing causality at all densities. By tuning existing energy density functionals we were able to: (a) account for a 2.6 Msun neutron star, (b) satisfy the original constraint on the tidal deformability of a 1.4 Msun neutron star, and (c) reproduce ground-state properties of finite nuclei. Yet, for the class of models explored in this work, we find that the stiffening of the equation of state required to support super-massive neutron stars is inconsistent with either constraints obtained from energetic heavy-ion collisions or from the low deformability of medium-mass stars. Thus, we speculate that the maximum neutron star mass can not be significantly higher than the existing observational limit and that the 2.6 Msun compact object is likely to be the lightest black hole ever discovered.},

Analyzing the 11 detections from LIGO/Virgo's first gravitational-wave catalog, GWTC-1, we investigate whether the power-law fit to the BH mass spectrum can also accommodate the binary neutron star (BNS) event GW170817, or whether we require an additional feature, such as a mass gap in between the NS and BH populations. We find that with respect to the power-law fit to binary black hole (BBH) masses, GW170817 is an outlier at the 0.13\% level, suggesting a distinction between NS and BH masses. A single power-law fit across the entire mass range is in mild tension with (a) the detection of one source in the BNS mass range ({$\sim$}1--2.5 M{$\odot$}), (b) the absence of detections in the ``mass-gap'' range ({$\sim$}2.5--5 M{$\odot$}), and (c) the detection of 10 sources in the BBH mass range ({$\greaterequivlnt$}5 M{$\odot$}). Instead, the data favor models with a feature between NS and BH masses, including a mass gap (Bayes factor of 4.6) and a break in the power law, with a steeper slope at NS masses compared to BH masses (91\% credibility). We estimate the merger rates of compact binaries based on our fit to the global mass distribution, finding and . We conclude that, even in the absence of any prior knowledge of the difference between NSs and BHs, the gravitational-wave data alone already suggest two distinct populations of compact objects.},

  abstract = {The progenitor system of the compact binary merger GW190425 had a total mass of \$3.4\textasciicircum\textbraceleft +0.3\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft -0.1\textbraceright\$ M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$ (90th-percentile confidence region) as measured from its gravitational wave signal. This mass is significantly different from the Milky Way (MW) population of binary neutron stars (BNSs) that are expected to merge in a Hubble time and from that of the first BNS merger, GW170817. Here we explore the expected electromagnetic signatures of such a system. We make several astrophysically motivated assumptions to further constrain the parameters of GW190425. By simply assuming that both components were NSs, we reduce the possible component masses significantly, finding \$m\_1 = 1.85\textasciicircum\textbraceleft +0.27\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft -0.19\textbraceright\$ M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$ and \$m\_2 = 1.47\textasciicircum\textbraceleft +0.16\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft -0.18\textbraceright\$ M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$. However if the GW190425 progenitor system was a NS-black hole merger, we find best-fitting parameters \$m\_1 = 2.19\textasciicircum\textbraceleft +0.21\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft -0.17\textbraceright\$ M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$ and \$m\_2 = 1.26\textasciicircum\textbraceleft +0.10\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft -0.08\textbraceright\$ M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$. For a well-motivated BNS system where the lighter NS has a mass similar to the mass of non-recycled NSs in MW BNS systems, we find \$m\_1 = 2.03\textasciicircum\textbraceleft +0.15\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft -0.14\textbraceright\$ M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$ and \$m\_2 = 1.35 \textbackslash pm 0.09\$ M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$, corresponding to only 7\% mass uncertainties. For all scenarios, we expect a prompt collapse of the resulting remnant to a black hole. Examining detailed models with component masses similar to our best-fitting results, we find the electromagnetic counterpart to GW190425 is expected to be significantly redder and fainter than that of GW170817. We find that almost all reported observations used to search for an electromagnetic counterpart for GW190425 were too shallow to detect the expected counterpart. If the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration promptly provides the chirp mass, the astronomical community can adapt their observations to improve the likelihood of detecting a counterpart for similarly "high-mass" BNS systems.

Using our current understanding of supernova engines, we derive mass distributions of stellar compact remnants.

We show how the depth of the mass gap between neutron stars and black holes can help probe this convective growth. We include a study of the effects of stochasticity in both the stellar structure and the convective seeds caused by stellar burning.

  abstract = {Electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations indicate that there is dearth of compact objects with mass {$\sim$}2.5--5~M{$\odot$}. This so-called `mass gap' may be linked to the supernova explosion mechanisms that produce neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). However, the existence of a few mass-gap compact objects, some of which have been confirmed to be BHs, poses a challenge to the traditional theory of black hole formation. In this work, we investigate the possible formation channel of BHs from accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of NSs in X-ray binaries. In particular, we consider the influence of super-Eddington accretion of NSs. Recent observations of ultraluminous X-ray pulsars suggest that their apparent luminosities may reflect the true accretion luminosities of the accreting NSs, even exceeding the Eddington limit by a factor of {$\greaterequivlnt$}100. Thus, NSs accreting at a super-Eddington accretion rate may rapidly grow into BHs in intermediate/low-mass X-ray binaries. Based on the super-Eddington accretion disc models, we have investigated the evolution of NSs in intermediate/low-mass X-ray binaries by combining binary population synthesis and detailed stellar evolutionary calculations. We show that super-Eddington accretion plays a critical role in mass growth of NSs, and the final masses of the descendant BHs are heavily dependent on the NS magnetic fields, the metallicity of the donor star, and the bifurcation period of the binaries. AIC of NSs may account for some of the observed mass-gap BHs like GRO~J0422+32. We also present the parameter distributions of the potential mass-gap BHs in a Milky Way-like galaxy, and point out that future space-based gravitational wave observations may provide important test of or constraints on the formation of mass-gap BHs from the AIC channel.},

The continued advancement of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration detectors have now produced a catalog of over 90 such mergers, from which we can begin to uncover the formation history of merging compact binaries. In this work, we search for subpopulations in the LVK's third gravitational wave transient catalog (GWTC-3) by incorporating discrete latent variables in the hierarchical Bayesian inference framework to probabilistically assign each BBH observation into separate categories associated with distinctly different population distributions. By incorporating formation channel knowledge within the mass and spin correlations found in each category, we find an over density of mergers with a primary mass of \$\textbackslash sim10 M\_\textbackslash odot\$, consistent with isolated binary formation. This low-mass subpopulation has a spin magnitude distribution peaking at \$a\_\textbackslash mathrm\textbraceleft peak\textbraceright =0.16\textasciicircum\textbraceleft 0.19\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft -0.16\textbraceright\$, exhibits spins preferentially aligned with the binary's orbital angular momentum, is constrained by \$15\textasciicircum\textbraceleft +0.0\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft -1.0\textbraceright\$ of our observations, and contributes \$82\textbackslash\%\textasciicircum\textbraceleft +8.0\textbackslash\%\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft -16\textbackslash\%\textbraceright\$ to the overall population of BBHs.

  abstract = {Compact objects observed via gravitational waves are classified as black holes or neutron stars primarily based on their inferred mass with respect to stellar evolution expectations. However, astrophysical expectations for the lowest mass range, \$\textbackslash lesssim 1.2 \textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$, are uncertain. If such low-mass compact objects exist, ground-based gravitational wave detectors may observe them in binary mergers. Lacking astrophysical expectations for classifying such observations, we go beyond the mass and explore the role of tidal effects. We evaluate how combined mass and tidal inference can inform whether each binary component is a black hole or a neutron star based on consistency with the supranuclear-density equation of state. Low-mass neutron stars experience a large tidal deformation; its observational identification (or lack thereof) can therefore aid in determining the nature of the binary components. Using simulated data, we find that the presence of a sub-solar mass neutron star (black hole) can be established with odds \$\textbackslash sim 100:1\$ when two neutron stars (black holes) merge and emit gravitational waves at signal-to-noise ratio \$\textbackslash sim 20\$. For the same systems, the absence of a black hole (neutron star) can be established with odds \$\textbackslash sim 10:1\$. For mixed neutron star-black hole binaries, we can establish that the system contains a neutron star with odds \$\textbackslash gtrsim 5:1\$. Establishing the presence of a black hole in mixed neutron star-black hole binaries is more challenging, except for the case of a \$\textbackslash lesssim 1\textbackslash,M\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash odot\textbraceright\$ black hole with a \$\textbackslash gtrsim 1\textbackslash,M\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash odot\textbraceright\$ neutron star companion. On the other hand, classifying each individual binary component suffers from an inherent labeling ambiguity.},

  abstract = {The origins of merging compact binaries observed by gravitational-wave detectors remains highly uncertain. Several astrophysical channels may contribute to the overall merger rate, with distinct formation processes imprinted on the structure and correlations in the underlying distributions of binary source parameters. In the absence of confident theoretical models, the current understanding of this population mostly relies on simple parametric models that make strong assumptions and are prone to misspecification. Recent work has made progress using more flexible nonparametric models, but detailed measurement of the multidimensional population remains challenging. In pursuit of this, we present PixelPop-a high resolution Bayesian nonparametric model to infer joint distributions and parameter correlations with minimal assumptions. PixelPop densely bins the joint parameter space and directly infers the merger rate in each bin, assuming only that bins are coupled to their nearest neighbors. We demonstrate this method on mock populations with and without bivariate source correlations, employing several statistical metrics for information gain and correlation significance to quantify our nonparametric results. We show that PixelPop correctly recovers the true populations within posterior uncertainties and offers a conservative assessment of population-level features and parameter correlations. Its flexibility and tractability make it a useful data-driven tool to probe gravitational-wave populations in multiple dimensions.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the number of pulsars with secure mass measurements has increased to a level that allows us to probe the underlying neutron star (NS) mass distribution in detail. We critically review the radio pulsar mass measurements. For the first time, we are able to analyze a sizable population of NSs with a flexible modeling approach that can effectively accommodate a skewed underlying distribution and asymmetric measurement errors. We find that NSs that have evolved through different evolutionary paths reflect distinctive signatures through dissimilar distribution peak and mass cutoff values. NSs in double neutron star and neutron star-white dwarf systems show consistent respective peaks at 1.33 Msun and 1.55 Msun suggesting significant mass accretion (delta m\textasciitilde 0.22 Msun) has occurred during the spin-up phase. The width of the mass distribution implied by double NS systems is indicative of a tight initial mass function while the inferred mass range is significantly wider for NSs that have gone through recycling. We find a mass cutoff at \textasciitilde 2.1 Msun for NSs with white dwarf companions which establishes a firm lower bound for the maximum NS mass. This rules out the majority of strange quark and soft equation of state models as viable configurations for NS matter. The lack of truncation close to the maximum mass cutoff along with the skewed nature of the inferred mass distribution both enforce the suggestion that the 2.1 Msun limit is set by evolutionary constraints rather than nuclear physics or general relativity, and the existence of rare super-massive NSs is possible.},

Simulations show that such failed SNe still eject their hydrogen envelopes in a weak transient, leaving a black hole with the mass of the star's helium core (5--8 M{$\Sun$}). Here we show that this naturally explains the typical masses of observed black holes and the gap between neutron star and black hole masses without any fine-tuning of stellar mass loss, binary mass transfer, or the SN mechanism, beyond having it fail in a mass range where many progenitor models have density structures that make the explosions more likely to fail. There is no difficulty including this {$\sim$}20\% population of failed SNe in any accounting of SN types over the progenitor mass function. And, other than patience, there is no observational barrier to either detecting these black hole formation events or limiting their rates to be well below this prediction.},

We find that significant errors can arise from the assumption of zero or constant emission from the accretion flow, which is commonly used when determining orbital inclination by modelling ellipsoidal variations. For A0620-00, the system with the best available data, we show that typical data sets and analysis procedures can lead to systematic underestimates of the inclination by ten degrees or more. A careful examination of the available data for the 15 other X-ray transients with low-mass donors suggests that this effect may significantly reduce the black hole mass estimates in several other cases, most notably that of GRO J0422+32. With these revisions, our analysis of the black hole mass distribution in soft X-ray transients does not suggest any "mass gap" between the low end of the distribution and the maximum theoretical neutron star mass, as has been identified in previous studies. Nevertheless, we find that the mass distribution retains other previously identified characteristics, namely a peak around 8M\textbackslash odot, a paucity of sources with masses below 5M\textbackslash odot, and a sharp drop-off above 10M\textbackslash odot.},

In this work, we combine information from recent observations to place joint constraints on the properties of neutron star matter. We use (i) lower limits on the maximum mass of neutron stars obtained through radio observations of heavy pulsars, (ii) constraints on tidal properties inferred through the gravitational waves neutron star binaries emit as they coalesce, and (iii) information about neutron stars' masses and radii obtained through X-ray emission from surface hot spots. In order to combine information from such distinct messengers while avoiding the kind of modeling systematics intrinsic to parametric inference schemes, we employ a nonparametric representation of the neutron-star equation of state based on Gaussian processes conditioned on nuclear theory models.

We investigate this measurement's implications for the neutron star equation of state (EoS), employing a nonparametric EoS model based on Gaussian processes and combining information from other x-ray, radio and gravitational-wave observations of neutron stars. Our analysis mildly disfavors EoSs that support a disconnected hybrid star branch in the mass-radius relation, a proxy for strong phase transitions, with a Bayes factor of 6.9. For such EoSs, the transition mass from the hadronic to the hybrid branch is constrained to lie outside (1,2) M{$\odot$}. We also find that the conformal sound-speed bound is violated inside neutron star cores, which implies that the core matter is strongly interacting. The squared sound speed reaches a maximum of 0.7⁢5+0.25-0.24⁢{$c$}2 at 3.60+2.25-1.89 times nuclear saturation density at 90\% credibility. Since all but the gravitational-wave observations prefer a relatively stiff EoS, PSR J⁢0740+6620's central density is only 3.57+1.3-1.3 times nuclear saturation, limiting the density range probed by observations of cold, nonrotating neutron stars in {$B$}-equilibrium.},

Their main-sequence companion stars are often strongly irradiated by the pulsar, displacing the effective center of light from their barycenter and making mass measurements uncertain. We present a series of optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of PSR J2215+5135, a ``redback'' binary MSP in a 4.14 hr orbit, and measure a drastic temperature contrast between the dark/cold (T N = 5660\textbraceleft\textbraceright -380+260 K) and bright/hot (T D = 8080\textbraceleft\textbraceright -280+470 K) sides of the companion star. We find that the radial velocities depend systematically on the atmospheric absorption lines used to measure them. Namely, the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve (RVC) of J2215 measured with magnesium triplet lines is systematically higher than that measured with hydrogen Balmer lines, by 10\%. We interpret this as a consequence of strong irradiation, whereby metallic lines dominate the dark side of the companion (which moves faster) and Balmer lines trace its bright (slower) side. Further, using a physical model of an irradiated star to fit simultaneously the two-species RVCs and the three-band light curves, we find a center-of-mass velocity of K 2 = 412.3 \textpm{} 5.0 km s-1 and an orbital inclination i = 63.{$^\circ$}9\textbraceleft\textbraceright -2.7+2.4.

We revisit the numerical simulations on the core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) for {$\sim$}20--40 M {$\odot$} progenitor stars with different initial explosion energies. As a result, the lower explosion energy naturally causes more efficient fallback accretion for low-metallicity progenitors, and then the newborn black holes (BHs) in the center of the CCSNe can escape from the gap, but neutron stars cannot easily collapse into BHs in the gap; nevertheless, the final remnants of the solar-metallicity progenitors stick to the gap. If we consider that only drastic CCSNe can be observed and that those with lower explosion energies are universal, the lower mass gap can be reasonably built. The width and depth of the gap are mainly determined by the typical CCSN initial explosion energy and metallicity. One can expect that the future multimessenger observations of compact objects delineate the shape of the gap, which might constrain the properties of the CCSNe and their progenitors.},

title = {{Striking a Chord with Spectral Sirens}: Multiple Features in the Compact Binary Population Correlate with H0},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Spectral siren measurements of the Hubble constant (H0) rely on correlations between observed detector-frame masses and luminosity distances. Features in the source-frame mass distribution can induce these correlations. It is crucial, then, to understand (i) which features in the source-frame mass distribution are robust against model (re)parameterization, (ii) which features carry the most information about H0, and (iii) whether distinct features independently correlate with cosmological parameters. We study these questions using real gravitational-wave observations from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations' third observing run. Although constraints on H0 are weak, we find that current data reveals several prominent features in the mass distribution, including peaks in the binary black hole source-frame mass distribution near ∼9M⊙ and ∼32M⊙ and a roll-off at masses above ∼46M⊙. For the first time using real data, we show that all of these features carry cosmological information and that the peak near ∼32M⊙ consistently correlates with H0 most strongly. Introducing model-independent summary statistics, we show that these statistics independently correlate with H0, exactly what is required to limit systematics within future spectral siren measurements from the (expected) astrophysical evolution of the mass distribution.}

GW170817 was followed by a range of EM counterparts, including a weak gamma-ray burst (GRB), kilonova (KN) emission from the radioactive decay of the merger ejecta, and X-ray/radio emission consistent with being the synchrotron afterglow of a more powerful off-axis jet. The type of compact remnant produced in the immediate merger aftermath, and its predicted EM signal, depend sensitively on the high-density NS equation of state (EOS). For a soft EOS which supports a low \$M\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash rm max\textbraceright\$, the merger undergoes a prompt collapse accompanied by a small quantity of shock-heated or disk wind ejecta, inconsistent with the large quantity \$\textbackslash gtrsim 10\textasciicircum\textbraceleft -2\textbraceright M\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash odot\textbraceright\$ of lanthanide-free ejecta inferred from the KN. On the other hand, if \$M\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash rm max\textbraceright\$ is sufficiently large, then the merger product is a rapidly-rotating supramassive NS (SMNS), which must spin-down before collapsing into a black hole. A fraction of the enormous rotational energy necessarily released by the SMNS during this process is transferred to the ejecta, either into the GRB jet (energy \$E\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash rm GRB\textbraceright\$) or the KN ejecta (energy \$E\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash rm ej\textbraceright\$), also inconsistent with observations. By combining the total binary mass of GW170817 inferred from the GW signal with conservative upper limits on \$E\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash rm GRB\textbraceright\$ and \$E\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash rm ej\textbraceright\$ from EM observations, we constrain the likelihood probability of a wide-range of previously-allowed EOS. These two constraints delineate an allowed region of the \$M\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash rm max\textbraceright -R\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash rm ns\textbraceright\$ parameter space, which once marginalized over NS radius places an upper limit of \$M\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash rm max\textbraceright{} \textbackslash lesssim 2.17M\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash odot\textbraceright\$ (90\textbackslash\%), which is tighter or arguably less model-dependent than other current constraints.},

While the primary was most likely a black hole, the secondary could be interpreted as either the lightest black hole or the most massive neutron star ever observed, but also as the indication of a novel class of exotic compact objects. We here argue that the secondary in GW190814 needs not be an ab-initio black hole nor an exotic object; rather, based on our current understanding of the nuclear-matter equation of state, it can be a rapidly rotating neutron star that collapsed to a rotating black hole at some point before merger. Using universal relations connecting the masses and spins of uniformly rotating neutron stars, we estimate the spin, \$0.49 \textbackslash lesssim \textbackslash chi \textbackslash lesssim 0.68\$, of the secondary -- a quantity not constrained so far by the detection -- and a novel strict lower bound on the maximum mass, \$M\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash rm TOV\textbraceright{} {$>$} 2.08\textasciicircum\textbraceleft +0.04\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft -0.04\textbraceright\textbackslash, \textbackslash,M\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash odot\textbraceright\$, of nonrotating neutron stars, consistent with recent observations of a very massive pulsar.

In this paper we study the gravitational equilibrium of masses of neutrons, using the equation of state for a cold Fermi gas, and general relativity. For masses under 13{$\odot$} only one equilibrium solution exists, which is approximately described by the nonrelativistic Fermi equation of state and Newtonian gravitational theory. For masses 13{$\odot$} {$<m$} {$<$}34{$\odot$} two solutions exist, one stable and quasi-Newtonian, one more condensed, and unstable. For masses greater than 34{$\odot$} there are no static equilibrium solutions. These results are qualitatively confirmed by comparison with suitably chosen special cases of the analytic solutions recently discovered by Tolman. A discussion of the probable effect of deviations from the Fermi equation of state suggests that actual stellar matter after the exhaustion of thermonuclear sources of energy will, if massive enough, contract indefinitely, although more and more slowly, never reaching true equilibrium.},

Recent instrumentation and computational advances have resulted in a rapid increase in the discovery rate and precise timing of radio pulsars in binaries in the past few years, leading to a large number of mass measurements. These discoveries show that the neutron-star mass distribution is much wider than previously thought, with three known pulsars now firmly in the 1.9--2.0-M{$\odot$} mass range. For radii, large, high-quality data sets from X-ray satellites as well as significant progress in theoretical modeling led to considerable progress in the measurements, placing them in the 10--11.5-km range and shrinking their uncertainties, owing to a better understanding of the sources of systematic errors. The combination of the massive-neutron-star discoveries, the tighter radius measurements, and improved laboratory constraints of the properties of dense matter has already made a substantial impact on our understanding of the composition and bulk properties of cold nuclear matter at densities higher than that of the atomic nucleus, a major unsolved problem in modern physics.},

In light of the new features found in the mass spectrum of binary black holes and the uncertainty regarding binary formation models, non-parametric population inference has become increasingly popular. In this work, we develop a data-driven clustering framework that can identify features in the component mass distribution of compact binaries simultaneously with those in the corresponding redshift distribution, from gravitational wave data in the presence of significant measurement uncertainties, while making very few assumptions on the functional form of these distributions. Our generalized model is capable of inferring correlations among various population properties such as the redshift evolution of the shape of the mass distribution itself, in contrast to most existing non-parametric inference schemes. We test our model on simulated data and demonstrate the accuracy with which it can re-construct the underlying distributions of component masses and redshifts. We also re-analyze public LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data from events in GWTC-3 using our model and compare our results with those from some alternative parametric and non-parametric population inference approaches. Finally, we investigate the potential presence of correlations between mass and redshift in the population of binary black holes in GWTC-3 (those observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network in their first 3 observing runs), without making any assumptions about the specific nature of these correlations.},

The higher (more positive) spin subpopulation is found to have a mass-spectrum without any feature at the \$30-40M\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash odot\textbraceright\$, which is consistent with the predictions of isolated stellar binary evolution, simulations for which place the pile up due to pulsational pair-instability supernovae near \$50M\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash odot\textbraceright\$ or higher. The other sub-population with effective spins closer to zero shows a feature at \$30-40M\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash odot\textbraceright\$ and is consistent with binary black holes formed dynamically in globular clusters, which are expected to peak around \$30M\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash odot\textbraceright\$. We also compute merger rates for these two subpopulations and find that they are consistent with the theoretical predictions of the corresponding formation channels. We validate our results by checking their robustness against variations of several model configurations and by analyzing large simulated catalogs with the same model.},

The companion is very faint at minimum brightness, presenting observational challenges, but we have measured multicolor light curves and obtained radial velocities over the illuminated ``day" half of the orbit. The model fits indicate system inclination \$i=59.8\textbackslash pm 1.9\textasciicircum\textbackslash circ\$ and a pulsar mass \$M\_\textbraceleft NS\textbraceright{} = 2.35\textbackslash pm 0.17 M\_\textbackslash odot\$, the largest well-measured mass found to date. Modeling uncertainties are small, since the heating is not extreme; the companion lies well within its Roche lobe and a simple direct-heating model provides the best fit. If the NS started at a typical pulsar birth mass, nearly \$1 M\_\textbackslash odot\$ has been accreted; this may be connected with the especially low intrinsic dipole surface field, estimated at \$6\textbackslash times 10\textasciicircum 7\$G. Joined with reanalysis of other black widow and redback pulsars, we find that the minimum value for the maximum NS mass is \$M\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash rm max\textbraceright{} {$>$} 2.19 M\_\textbackslash odot\$\$(2.09 M\_\textbackslash odot)\$ at \$1\textbackslash sigma\$\$(3\textbackslash sigma)\$ confidence.

  abstract = {Mass measurements from low-mass black hole X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and radio pulsars have been used to identify a gap between the most massive neutron stars (NSs) and the least massive black holes (BHs). BH mass measurements in LMXBs are typically only possible for transient systems: outburst periods enable detection via all-sky X-ray monitors, while quiescent periods enable radial velocity measurements of the low-mass donor. We quantitatively study selection biases due to the requirement of transient behavior for BH mass measurements. Using rapid population synthesis simulations (COSMIC), detailed binary stellar-evolution models (MESA), and the disk instability model of transient behavior, we demonstrate that transient LMXB selection effects introduce observational biases, and can suppress mass-gap BHs in the observed sample. However, we find a population of transient LMXBs with mass-gap BHs form through accretion-induced collapse of an NS during the LMXB phase, which is inconsistent with observations. These results are robust against variations of binary evolution prescriptions. The significance of this accretion-induced collapse population depends upon the maximum NS birth mass . To reflect the observed dearth of low-mass BHs, COSMIC and MESA models favor . In the absence of further observational biases against LMXBs with mass-gap BHs, our results indicate the need for additional physics connected to the modeling of LMXB formation and evolution.},

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Both detailed and rapid population studies alike predict that binary black hole (BHBH) formation is orders of magnitude more efficient at low metallicity than high metallicity, while binary neutron star (NSNS) formation remains mostly flat with metallicity, and black hole–neutron star mergers show intermediate behavior. This finding is a key input to employ double compact objects as tracers of low-metallicity star formation, as spectral sirens, and for merger rate calculations. Yet the literature offers various (sometimes contradicting) explanations for these trends. We investigate the dominant cause for the metallicity dependence of double compact object formation. We find that the BHBH formation efficiency at low metallicity is set by initial condition distributions, and conventional simulations suggest that about one in eight interacting binary systems with sufficient mass to form black holes will lead to a merging BHBH. We further find that the significance of metallicities in double compact object formation is a question of formation channel. The stable mass transfer and chemically homogeneous evolution channels mainly diminish at high metallicities due to changes in stellar radii, while the common envelope channel is primarily impacted by the combined effects of stellar winds and mass-scaled natal kicks. Outdated giant wind prescriptions exacerbate the latter effect, suggesting that BHBH formation may be much less metallicity-dependent than previously assumed. NSNS formation efficiency remains metallicity-independent, as they form exclusively through the common envelope channel, with natal kicks that are assumed to be uncorrelated with mass. Forthcoming gravitational-wave observations will provide valuable constraints on these findings.}

  abstract = {On 17 August 2017, the LIGO and Virgo observatories made the first direct detection of gravitational waves from the coalescence of a neutron star binary system. The detection of this gravitational-wave signal, GW170817, offers a novel opportunity to directly probe the properties of matter at the extreme conditions found in the interior of these stars. The initial, minimal-assumption analysis of the LIGO and Virgo data placed constraints on the tidal effects of the coalescing bodies, which were then translated to constraints on neutron star radii. Here, we expand upon previous analyses by working under the hypothesis that both bodies were neutron stars that are described by the same equation of state and have spins within the range observed in Galactic binary neutron stars. Our analysis employs two methods: the use of equation-of-state-insensitive relations between various macroscopic properties of the neutron stars and the use of an efficient parametrization of the defining function {$p$}⁡({$\rho$}) of the equation of state itself. From the LIGO and Virgo data alone and the first method, we measure the two neutron star radii as {$R$}1=10.8+2.0-1.7 km for the heavier star and {$R$}2=10.7+2.1-1.5 km for the lighter star at the 90\% credible level. If we additionally require that the equation of state supports neutron stars with masses larger than 1.97 M{$\odot$} as required from electromagnetic observations and employ the equation-of-state parametrization, we further constrain {$R$}1=11.9+1.4-1.4 km and {$R$}2=11.9+1.4-1.4 km at the 90\% credible level. Finally, we obtain constraints on {$p$}⁡({$\rho$}) at supranuclear densities, with pressure at twice nuclear saturation density measured at 3.5+2.7-1.7\texttimes 1034 dyn cm-2 at the 90\% level.},

These stars are assumed to form in binary systems when their expanding hydrogenic envelopes are promptly lost just after helium ignition. Significant differences are found with single star evolution, chiefly because the helium core loses mass during helium burning rather than gaining it from hydrogen shell burning. Consequently presupernova stars for a given initial mass function have considerably smaller mass when they die and will be easier to explode. Even accounting for this difference, the helium stars with mass loss develop more centrally condensed cores that should explode more easily than their single-star counterparts. The production of low mass black holes may be diminished. Helium stars with initial masses below 3.2 Msun experience significant radius expansion after helium depletion, reaching blue supergiant proportions. This could trigger additional mass exchange or affect the light curve of the supernova. The most common black hole masses produced in binaries is estimated to be about 9 Msun. A new maximum mass for black holes derived from pulsational pair-instability supernovae is derived - 46 Msun, and a new potential gap at 10 - 12 Msun is noted. Models pertinent to SN 2014ft are presented and a library of presupernova models is generated.},

  abstract = {The existence of a mass gap of 3--5 M{$\odot$} between the heaviest neutron stars (NSs) and the lightest black holes (BHs), inferred from the BH mass distribution in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), has been suggested for decades. The gravitational-wave (GW) source GW230529 is most likely a neutron star--black hole (NSBH) merger, with the BH mass falling within this gap. This detection strongly challenges the existence of the gap and has implications for the NSBH population, including a revised BH mass distribution and an updated local merger rate. In this study, we employ POSYDON, a binary population synthesis code that integrates detailed single- and binary-star models, to investigate coalescing NSBH binaries, focusing on the BH mass distribution of the intrinsic NSBH merger population. For typical population models, we find that better matching the observed BH mass distribution requires the use of common-envelope (CE) efficiencies exceeding unity, a rather uncomfortable choice since most energy sources are already included. Alternatively, we find that a two-stage CE prescription calibrated to 1D hydrodynamic simulations has a similar effect. Moreover, motivated by a possible explanation for the firm presence of the mass gap in the LMXB sample, we examine models where the NS birth mass is limited to {$\lessequivlnt$}2 M{$\odot$} and find excellent agreement with GW observations. Additionally, we present observable distributions of NSBH merger properties, finding good agreement with the measured properties of observed systems and a predicted fraction of NSBH mergers with potential electromagnetic counterparts that ranges from 1\% all the way up to 32\%.},

  abstract = {Gravitational-wave (GW) detections of merging neutron star-black hole (NSBH) systems probe astrophysical neutron star (NS) and black hole (BH) mass distributions, especially at the transition between NS and BH masses. Of particular interest are the maximum NS mass, minimum BH mass, and potential mass gap between them. While previous GW population analyses assumed all NSs obey the same maximum mass, if rapidly spinning NSs exist, they can extend to larger maximum masses than nonspinning NSs. In fact, several authors have proposed that the \$\textbackslash sim2.6\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$ object in the event GW190814 -- either the most massive NS or least massive BH observed to date -- is a rapidly spinning NS. We therefore infer the NSBH mass distribution jointly with the NS spin distribution, modeling the NS maximum mass as a function of spin. Using 4 LIGO-Virgo NSBH events including GW190814, if we assume that the NS spin distribution is uniformly distributed up to the maximum (breakup) spin, we infer the maximum non-spinning NS mass is \$2.7\textasciicircum\textbraceleft +0.5\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft -0.4\textbraceright\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$ (90\textbackslash\% credibility), while assuming only nonspinning NSs, the NS maximum mass must be \${$>$}2.53 M\_\textbackslash odot\$ (90\textbackslash\% credibility). The data support the mass gap's existence, with a minimum BH mass at \$5.4\textasciicircum\textbraceleft +0.7\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft -1.0\textbraceright{} M\_\textbackslash odot\$. With future observations, under simplified assumptions, 150 NSBH events may constrain the maximum nonspinning NS mass to \$\textbackslash pm0.02\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$, and we may even measure the relation between the NS spin and maximum mass entirely from GW data. If rapidly rotating NSs exist, their spins and masses must be modeled simultaneously to avoid biasing the NS maximum mass.},

This so-called lower mass gap was initially suggested by the lack of low-mass X-ray binary observations with accretors about \$2-5\textbackslash,M\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash odot\textbraceright\$, but it has recently been called into question following newer observations, including a lower-mass-gap candidate with a millisecond pulsar companion in the dense globular cluster NGC 1851.

We demonstrate that both massive star evolution and dynamical interactions can contribute to forming lower-mass-gap black holes.

Additionally, the lower-mass-gap black holes can also become components of dynamically assembled binaries, and some will be in merging black hole - neutron star systems similar to the recently detected gravitational wave source GW230529.
